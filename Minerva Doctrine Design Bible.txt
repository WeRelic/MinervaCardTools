Relic Card Game:

Basic Mechanics & Winstate:
    Commander:
        Commanders must reach the opposite side of the board for a player to win the game.
        If a commander loses a battle against a unit, it gets reset to it's starting tile.
        Commanders start with 3 HP, and lose 1 HP every time they are reset to their starting tile.
    
    Units and commanders cannot move on tiles without terrain.  
    
    Players can trade resources and terrain tiles.
    

Resources:
    Energy (green):
        Each player gets 2 energy per turn before any other tile gets placed and starts with 6 energy.
        Unit movement costs 2 energy per tile, or 1 energy per tile containing a road.
    
    Ore (red):
        Allows players to place roads and is used for "early game" cards
    
    
    Research (white):
        Allows players to play higher powered cards, primarily draw and infiltration cards (similar to MTG's blue)


    Alloys:
        Allows players generate units and play "removal/damage" style cards.

    Scrap:
